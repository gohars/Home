				A typical Pakistani breakfast or Nashta &#40;ناشتہ‎&#41; is usually comprised of, but not limited to Chai, Parata and Halwa Puri. Here are many other
                dishes that Pakistanis eat for breakfast but as I said before, it mainly depends on the region of Pakistan that you are in, the closer the 
                region is to another country the more it inhibits from their culture.
