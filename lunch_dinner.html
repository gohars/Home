		<h2>Lunch and Dinner</h2>
			<p>
			For lunch and dinner, Pakistanis eat the same dishes interchangeably. When making lunch we usually prepare for dinner 
            at the same time. Of course, anything that goes with the main dish, like salads, raita, and beverages are made only when the 
            dish is being eaten. On this page, you will learn more about what Pakistanis eat at lunch and dinner.
